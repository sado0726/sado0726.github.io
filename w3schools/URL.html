nit picky stuff about URL encoding:
	URLs can only be ASCII
	URL encoding replaces non ASCII character with a "%" followed by hex
	URLs cannot contain space so it replaces all space with plus (+) sign or %20

		XHTML stands for Extensible HyperText Markup Language
		<br> almost identical to HTML but stricter and is supported by all major browsers
		<br> By combining HTML and XML together, XHTML was developed.
		<br> <strong>Few mandatory concepts:</strong>
		<br> DOCTYPE necessary, html, head, title, body necessary, html must have something in it.
		<br> properly nested, closed, lowercase, one root elemtn, attribute names lowercase and quoted, and can't be minimized
